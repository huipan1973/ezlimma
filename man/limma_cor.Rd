\title{Test correlation of each row of object to phenotype using moderated variance}
\usage{
limma_cor(object, phenotype = NULL, design = NULL, prefix = NULL,
  weights = NA, trend = FALSE, adjust.method = "BH",
  reorder.rows = TRUE, reduce.df = 0, cols = c("AveExpr", "P.Value",
  "adj.P.Val", "logFC"))
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A matrix-like data object containing log-ratios or 
log-expression values for a series of samples, with rows corresponding to 
genes and columns to samples.}

\item{phenotype}{Vector of phenotypes of the samples. Should be same length as
\code{ncol(object)}. If the vector is named, names should match 
\code{colnames(object)}.}

\item{design}{the design matrix of the experiment, with rows corresponding to 
samples and columns to coefficients to be estimated. Can be used to provide 
covariates.}

\item{prefix}{character string to add to beginning of column names.}

\item{weights}{non-negative observation weights. Can be a numeric matrix of 
individual weights, of same size as the object expression matrix, or a 
numeric vector of array weights with length equal to \code{ncol} of the 
expression matrix, or a numeric vector of gene weights with length equal to 
\code{nrow} of the expression matrix. Set to \code{NULL} to ignore \code{object$weights}. \code{weights=NA} 
 (with length one) doesn't pass weights to \code{limma}.}

\item{trend}{logical, should an intensity-trend be allowed for the prior 
variance? Default is that the prior variance is constant.}

\item{adjust.method}{method used to adjust the p-values for multiple testing.}

\item{reorder.rows}{logical, should rows be reordered by F-statistic from 
\code{\link[limma]{toptable}} or be left in the same order as 
\code{object}?}

\item{reduce.df}{Number of degrees of freedom to subtract from residual. This may be necessary if
\code{\link[limma]{removeBatchEffect}} was previously applied to \code{object}. Must be <= df.residual returned by
\code{\link[limma]{lmFit}}.}

\item{cols}{columns of \code{topTable} output the user would like in the 
result. Some column names, such as \code{adj.P.Val} are changed. If \code{logFC}
is specified, \code{FC} will also be given.}
}
\value{
Dataframe.

\description{
Test correlation of each row of object to phenotype using 
\code{design=model.matrix(~1+phenotype)}, testing 2nd coefficient.
}
\details{
Exactly one of \code{design} or \code{phenotype} must be non-null. If \code{design} is \code{NULL} and \code{phenotype} 
is given, design will be calculated as \code{model.matrix(~0+phenotype)}. See further details in \code{\link[limma]{lmFit}}.
